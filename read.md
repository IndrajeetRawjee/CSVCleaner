Data Cleaning in CSV:**     - Use Python (Pandas) or Node.js (Lodash/CSV library) to:        - Read data from a CSV file.        
- Handle missing values by filling them with appropriate defaults or removing rows.       
- Remove duplicate entries based on specific columns.        
- Convert data types for columns (e.g., string to number).        
- Write the cleaned data to a new CSV file.
